# Face-Detection-and-Recognisation
Overview
This project combines Haar Cascade and HOG algorithms for face detection and recognition. Additionally, it integrates Arduino for real-time interaction and control. The Haar Cascade and HOG algorithms are implemented using OpenCV, and the Arduino code is provided for seamless integration with the hardware components.

Features
Face detection using Haar Cascade algorithm.
Face recognition using HOG algorithm.
Real-time interaction with Arduino.

Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.x
OpenCV
NumPy
Arduino IDE
(Any additional libraries specified in the requirements.txt file)

Acknowledgments
The face detection and recognition algorithms are based on OpenCV's Haar Cascade and HOG implementations.
Arduino integration inspired by Arduino Official Documentation.
